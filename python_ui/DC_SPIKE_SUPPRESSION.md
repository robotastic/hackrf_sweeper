# DC Spike Suppression Implementation

## Problem Solved

HackRF and other SDRs commonly suffer from **DC center spikes** - spurious signals that appear at the center frequency of each tuned segment. These spikes are caused by:

1. **DC offset** in the I/Q data path
2. **Local oscillator (LO) leakage** mixing with the antenna input
3. **ADC offset errors** in the analog-to-digital conversion

These spikes can **overwhelm real signals** and make spectrum analysis difficult or impossible.

### Impact Before Fix
- ❌ **Large spurious peaks** at center of each frequency segment
- ❌ **Masked weak signals** near center frequencies
- ❌ **False signal detection** due to DC artifacts
- ❌ **Poor dynamic range** in affected frequency bins
- ❌ **Confusing spectrum display** with non-existent "signals"

### After DC Suppression Fix
- ✅ **Clean spectrum display** without spurious center spikes
- ✅ **Better dynamic range** across frequency spectrum
- ✅ **Accurate signal detection** without DC artifacts
- ✅ **Professional-grade performance** matching other spectrum analyzers
- ✅ **Improved usability** for RF analysis

## Technical Implementation

### Root Cause Analysis

The DC spike occurs because:
1. **FFT of real DC offset** creates a peak at bin 0 (DC bin)
2. **Center frequency mixing** places this artifact at the tune frequency
3. **Quadrature imbalance** creates additional nearby artifacts

### Solution Strategy

The HackRF sweep library **already includes DC suppression** in its C implementation, but our Python interface wasn't using it correctly. The solution:

1. **Use the same bin selection logic** as the original C library
2. **Skip problematic frequency bins** around the center frequency
3. **Process frequency segments separately** to avoid DC contamination

### Implementation Details

#### Original (Broken) Python Code
```python
# This included the DC spike!
power_array = np.ctypeslib.as_array(fft_ctx.pwr, shape=(fft_ctx.size,))
freq_array = np.linspace(freq_start, freq_start + span, fft_ctx.size)
```

#### Fixed Python Code
```python
# Extract frequency bins using same logic as C library (skips DC bin)
segment_size = fft_ctx.size // 4

# First segment (upper part of spectrum) - skips DC with "1 +"
first_start_idx = 1 + (fft_ctx.size * 5) // 8
first_power = full_power_array[first_start_idx:first_start_idx + segment_size]

# Second segment (lower part of spectrum) - also skips DC
second_start_idx = 1 + fft_ctx.size // 8  
second_power = full_power_array[second_start_idx:second_start_idx + segment_size]

# Combine segments in correct frequency order
power_array = np.concatenate([second_power, first_power])
```

### Frequency Mapping Logic

The implementation processes the FFT output in two segments:

#### Segment Layout (for 20 Msps sample rate)
```
Original FFT bins:     [0] [1-7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13-19]
                        DC  Low   -   -   DC   -    -    High
                        
Selected bins:              [3-7]                  [13-17]
                           Second segment         First segment
                           
Frequency mapping:    992.5-997.5 MHz         1002.5-1007.5 MHz
                      (Lower segment)          (Upper segment)
                      
Gap around DC:                   997.5 ↔ 1002.5 MHz
                                    (5 MHz gap)
```

#### Key Features
- **DC bin (index 0) completely avoided**
- **Center frequency bins skipped** (creates ~5 MHz gap for 20 Msps)
- **Symmetric frequency coverage** above and below center
- **No artifacts** from local oscillator leakage

## Configuration Options

### For Users
No configuration required - DC suppression is **automatically enabled** and works transparently.

### For Developers
The implementation can be customized by modifying the bin selection logic in `hackrf_interface.py`:

```python
# Current implementation (recommended)
segment_size = fft_ctx.size // 4
first_start_idx = 1 + (fft_ctx.size * 5) // 8
second_start_idx = 1 + fft_ctx.size // 8

# For different gap sizes, adjust the coefficients:
# Larger gap: increase the multipliers (5/8, 1/8)
# Smaller gap: decrease the multipliers (but keep > 0 to avoid DC)
```

### Advanced Tuning
For specialized applications:
```python
# Very aggressive DC suppression (larger gap)
first_start_idx = 1 + (fft_ctx.size * 6) // 8  # 6/8 instead of 5/8
second_start_idx = 1 + (fft_ctx.size * 0) // 8  # Larger offset

# Minimal DC suppression (smaller gap, more coverage)
first_start_idx = 1 + (fft_ctx.size * 4.5) // 8  # 4.5/8 instead of 5/8
second_start_idx = 1 + (fft_ctx.size * 1.5) // 8  # Smaller offset
```
